# Spencer's personal website

This is my home page on the internet, where I sometimes go by the name Spengrah

Built with the [gatsby-dimension-starter](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension`) designed by HTML5 UP. 

## Installation

Clone this repo, install gatsby with `nmp install -g gatsby-cli` (if you don't have gatsby already), run `npm install` and then `gatsby develop` in the terminal to start the dev site.
